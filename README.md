Hello!

If you are worrying about ZFS on Linux stability you should read this [perfect manual from Richard Yao](https://clusterhq.com/blog/state-zfs-on-linux/).

You can find here bunch of tests and docs about ZFS support in OpenVZ and vice versa :)

* [Comparison table of all availible storage backends for OpenVZ](openvz_storage_backends.md)
* [Installing OpenVZ container in ZFS native volume, english](OpenVZ_containers_on_zfs_filesystem.md)
* [Using ZFS with OpenVZ, zvol with ext4, english](http://www.stableit.ru/2014/07/using-zfs-with-openvz-openvzfs.html)
* [Why we need ZFS for OpenVZ, russian](why_russian.md)
* [Different cases of behaviour zvol with ext4 and OpenVZ, russian](zvol_ext4_cases.pdf)
* [Ideas about OpenVZ container on ZFS zvol with ext4, russian](openvz_and_zfs_zvol_ext4.pdf)


How you can help?
